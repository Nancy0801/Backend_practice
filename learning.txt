difference between dependency and dev dependency is that the dev dependencies are only used for development purpose , these does not go in production.


whenever you try to talk with database then always remember database is in other continent that means it can be time consuming to talk with it , so always use async await whenever to talk with database.
also there can be many errors while interacting with db so always use try catch block to deal with errors.

whenever you will make changes to env file , you hhave to restart the server , nodemon will not do anything in that case.
